* G. Essl, R. Belton, Topology-Preserving Deformations of Streaming Audio via Box Snake Surgery, Submitted to the International Computer Music Conference, Boston, USA, 2025.

This source code aims to provide proof-of-concept implementations of the theory and applied problems discussed in the above papers. It is not meant to be consumer-grade software, does not guarantee to cover edge cases and so fourth. Regardless the central algorithms should be reusable for applications of the ideas presented in the above paper with no or minimal effort. It is provided for a number of purposes: Facilitate review, provide reproducible research, and allow for easy use in interactive demonstrations, slides and other expository purposes.
